		<description>Repackage any of your tweaks locally, without the need to download it from Cydia again.</description>
		<description>This is super usefull when there is an update of your until now perfectly working tweak in Cydia and you want to make a backup of the version installed.</description>
		<description>Normally you wouldn't be able to backup anything because it is possible to fetch only the most current version of your tweak and so you would be lost. Not anymore :)))</description>

	<changelog>
		<change>0.9.4</change>
		<change>made a colored output so it will be easier to notice all the information which comes from it.</change>
